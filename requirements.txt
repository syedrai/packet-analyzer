## **📜 Requirements & Notes for Your Packet Analyzer Project**  

### **🔧 Dependencies Required**  
Before running the program, you need to install the following dependencies:  

```bash
pip install scapy  
pip install tk  
pip install pandas  
pip install matplotlib  
```

| Dependency | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `scapy` | Captures and analyzes network packets. |
| `tkinter` | Provides a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for the packet sniffer. |
| `pandas` | Saves and processes captured packets into a structured format (CSV). |
| `matplotlib` | Generates **graphs and visualizations** of captured packet data. |

---

### **📂 Project Structure**
| File Name | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `main.py` | The core script with GUI, packet capturing, and vulnerability detection. |
| `requirements.txt` | List of all required dependencies for easy installation. |
| `README.md` | Project documentation and instructions. |
| `logs/` | Directory where **captured packets** are saved in CSV format. |

### **📌 How It Works**
1. **Start the Packet Sniffer**  
   - Click **Start Sniffing** in the GUI.  
   - It captures packets from **all available network interfaces** (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.).  

2. **View Packet Data**  
   - The GUI **displays real-time packets**, including **source/destination IPs, protocols, and data**.  

3. **Stop & Save Logs**  
   - Clicking **Stop Sniffing** saves the captured packets into a **CSV file** for later analysis.  

4. **Vulnerability Detection**  
   - Identifies **insecure connections** (like HTTP instead of HTTPS).  
   - Detects **suspicious IP addresses** or protocols.

### **💻 Installation & Running the Program**
1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/syedrai/Packet-Analyzer.git  
cd Packet-Analyzer  
```

2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

3️⃣ **Run the Packet Analyzer**  
```bash
python main.py  
```

### **📊 Future Improvements**
✅ Add **Graphical Network Analysis** (Visualize packet traffic using Matplotlib).  
✅ Implement **Machine Learning** to detect **malicious packets**.  
✅ Allow **packet filtering** (capture only specific types of packets).
